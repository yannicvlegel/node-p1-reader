# Node.js P1-Reader
Node.js package for reading and parsing data from the P1 port of a Dutch Smart Meter.
Data is parsed according to the official DSMR4.0 specification by Netbeheer Nederland, which is currently used by most popular Kaifa and Landis+Gyr Smart Meters.

How to use
==========

The serial connection is automatically opened on initiating the P1-Reader. Use the `reading` event to start receiving data, which should come in every 10 seconds.

```
const P1Reader = require('p1-reader');
const p1Reader = new P1Reader({
    port: '/dev/tty-usbserial1',
    baudRate: 115200,
    parity: "even",
    dataBits: 7,
    stopBits: 1
});

p1Reader.on('reading', data => {
    console.log('Currently consuming: ' + data.electricity.received.actual.reading + data.electricity.received.actual.unit);
});

p1Reader.on('error', err => {
    console.log('Error while reading: ' + err);
});
```

Force specific serial port
==========================

If for some reason the automatic serial port discovery does not work it is possible to force a certain port with a specific configuration.

Provide a `serialPort` object as option parameter to set a specific serial port configuration. The object should contain all of the following field:
* `port` : Portname of the serial port on which the Smart Meter is connected (e.g. '/dev/ttyUSB0')
* `baudRate` : Baud rate of the serial port (e.g. '9600' or '115200')
* `parity` : Parity of the serial port (e.g. 'none' or 'even')
* `dataBits` : Number of data bits used for the serial port (e.g. '7' or '8')
* `stopBits` : Number of stop bits used for the serial port (e.g. '1')

Events
======

The module emits the following events:

* `connected` : When a connection with the Smart Meter was successfully setup
* `reading` : When a reading is received via the serial connection (should be on a 10 second interval)
* `reading-raw` : Same as the `reading` event but instead returning the raw data as a string
* `error` : When the serial connection emits an error
* `close` : When the serial connection closes for some reason

Reading structure
=================

The `reading` event returns the following data structure:

Emulator mode
==========

Since your development machine is usually not connected to the serial port directly the emulator mode can be enabled.
When enabled the module will not connect to a serial port but instead will use a mocked version that will emit messages according to the DSMR 4.0 specification.

The emulator will emit a reading event every 10 seconds just like an actual Smart Meter would do with the most important variables (timestamp, electricity.received.tariff1, electricity.received.actual, gas.timestamp and gas.reading) being incremented.

Provide the `emulator` option parameter to run the module in emulator mode:

```
const p1Reader = new P1Reader({emulator: true});
```

The emulator defaults can be overriden by passing an `emulatorOverrides` object, which can contain the following parameters:

* `electricityOffset` : Starting value of electricity on tariff 1 in kWh (default: 0)
* `electricityIncrement` : Incremental value (every 10 seconds) of electricity on tariff 1 in kW (default: 0.1)
* `gasOffset` : Starting value of gas in m3 (default: 0)
* `gasIncrement` : Incremental value (every hour) of gas in m3 (default: 0.1)
* `interval` : Interval (in seconds) in which readings are emitted (default: 10)
* `intervalGas` Interval (in seconds) in which the gas reading is incremented (default: 3600)

Debug mode
==========

In debug mode all raw and parsed packages are written to 2 separate log files (debug-data-raw.log and debug-data-parsed.log) and stored in the directory from which the module was triggered.

Provide the `debug` option parameter to run the module in debug mode:

```
const p1Reader = new P1Reader({debug: true});
```

Official DSMR documentation
===========================

The official DSMR Smart Meter P1 interface documentation from Netbeheer Nederland can be found here:

This documentation was used as a reference to create and verify this module.

Changelog
=========
2.0.0
- Adding support for DSMR2.2 Smart Meters (tested with Kamstrup 162 model)
- Removing serial port auto discovery functionality since it causes issues on many devices, resulting in the need to change the initialisation parameters of this model and therefore a major version bump

1.5.0
- Serial port auto discovery function now also tries different configurations to allow to automatically connect to any DSMR 4+ Smart Meter
- Allow forcing both a specific port and configuration (baudrate, parity, databits and stopbits) - Note that the "port" parameter is replaced, which is not backwards compatible
- Removing the "crash on purpose" when a smart meter could not be found
- Improving debug logging for better traceability of issues
- Upgrading "node-serialport" dependency to latest version for improved stability
- Applying ES6 standards to code

1.4.1
- Minor bug fix on incorrectly returning the LongPowerFailureLog object

1.4.0
- Exposing and calculating the datetime of the start of a LongPowerFailure
- Added the 'reading-raw' event to retrieve the raw data (as a string) that was retrieved from the Smart Meter

1.3.1
- Added option to control the interval of the emulator mode via an option parameter

1.3.0
- Added emulator mode for development purposes
- Extended example with all possible option parameters

1.2.0
- Upgraded serialport to 4.0.7
- Serial port is now automatically locked preventing other processes from opening it
- Added 'connected' event
- Exposed used serial port name via getSerialPort()

1.1.1
- Minor bug fix

1.1.0
- Added option to force a specific port
- Log more debugging information

1.0.1
